Talk Bot is built using the Flite speech synthesis engine from Carnegie Mellon University.

The integration of Flite under MonoTouch here is based upon the wiki post by Jim Bentley: http://wiki.monotouch.net/HowTo/Interop/Interopping_with_Open_Source_Text-to-Speech_(TTS)_C_libraries__for_iPhone.
  
The included project is configured to run on a device. See Jim's post for instructions on rebuilding for the simulator.
  
Glass buttons created using Martin Bowling's glass button generator.
